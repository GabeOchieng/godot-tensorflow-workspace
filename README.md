## Tensorflow 2.0 for Godot

<Wikipedia\> TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. 

This is Tensorflow for Godot Engine. The demo classifies an image into labels. This is a base for more interesting ideas like image upscaling, ai bots, chat bots, animations and others.

* Compile godot
* Open the example project
* Run the game
* See classification of the image

## Build Godot

Go to `src/thirdparty/godot` and compile using `scons platform=windows tools=yes -j8`. Your platform may be different.

Use https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.html as reference.

Execute the binary in `src/thirdparty/godot/bin` and open the project.
